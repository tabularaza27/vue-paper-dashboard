# [TreemTeam] 

> BCX 2019 Hackaton Project

The idea is to track every single tree by applying a low cost solution: a QR code in a elastic band that can flex as the tree grows. Moreover, the NGO can create a farmer union forcing the big companies to pay a fair price to the locals.

This project is a vue version of [Paper-dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard)
designed for vue js. The dashboard include real time tree data visualization on the map with detailed single view, QR code detenction and tree size esimation as well as a scheduler of action required for the farmer.
